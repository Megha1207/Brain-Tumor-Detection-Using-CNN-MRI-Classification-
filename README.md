# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-CNN-MRI-Classification-
This project builds a CNN-based system to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. Images are preprocessed, augmented, and classified into tumor or no-tumor categories. The model achieves strong performance, includes Grad-CAM for interpretability, and is deployed using FastAPI and Streamlit for easy real-time predictions.
